# Example Check Plugin

This directory contains an example of a check plugin for clusterlint. Plugins
can be used to implement checks that are not appropriate for addition to
clusterlint itself for whatever reason - e.g., because they encode a best
practice that is highly specific to a particular organization.

## Building

Build the plugin as a Go plugin:

```console
$ go build -buildmode=plugin github.com/bizflycloud/clusterlint/example-plugin
```

You should end up with a file called `example-plugin.so` in your working
directory.

## Usage

You can then use the plugin by loading it into clusterlint at runtime:

```console
$ clusterlint --plugins=./example-plugin.so run -c example-plugin
[suggestion] kube-system/pod/kubelet-rubber-stamp-f6756bc78-6sl9r: You probably don't want to run the example plugin.
```

The example plugin produces a suggestion for each pod running in the cluster,
just to show what a plugin can do.

## Caveats

### Supported Platforms

Go plugins are [supported only on Linux and macOS](https://golang.org/pkg/plugin/#pkg-overview).

### Versioning

Plugins **must** be built against the exact same version of the clusterlint
codebase as the clusterlint binary you are using, as well as against the same
version of all dependencies.

If the version used to build the plugin doesn't match the binary version you'll
get a message like:

```
plugin.Open("./example-plugin"): plugin was built with a different version of package github.com/bizflycloud/clusterlint/kube
```

We recommend using go module versioning to ensure you're building your plugin
against code from the clusterlint release you're using. If you build clusterlint
using the vendored dependencies, make sure you also build your plugins using the
vendored dependencies.
